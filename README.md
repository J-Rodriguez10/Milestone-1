# 🚀 **AstroHub: Explore the Cosmos** 🌌

AstroHub is a web application that allows users to explore space using NASA's APIs. This project was created as part of the **Software Engineering 1 (CS361) course in the Computer Science program at Oregon State University. The goal of the course was to teach **inclusivity heuristics** and collaborative software development through **microservices** and **agile sprints**.

In addition to developing my own microservices, I contributed to a teammate's microservice. You can find the GitHub repository for the microservice I implemented for a team member here: [Teammate's Microservice Repository](https://github.com/J-Rodriguez10/weather-microservice).


We followed the agile development process and worked in sprints to iteratively develop features and incorporate feedback.
## ♿ **Inclusivity Heuristics**

- Designed with [**all eight inclusivity heuristics**](https://open.oregonstate.education/setextbook/chapter/inclusivity-heuristics/) in mind to ensure the application is accessible to a wide range of users.
- Incorporates accessibility best practices to improve user experience.

## 📱 **Responsive Design**

- All pages are fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
- Extra effort was put into ensuring a consistent and visually appealing experience across all devices.

## 🌐 **Live Demo**

**NOTE Microservices Integration:** For the purpose of the live demo, microservices were integrated directly into the main project. This decision was made to simplify deployment while demonstrating the core functionality

👉 Check out the live demo here: [Live Demo Link](https://astrohub-portfolio-project.vercel.app/)

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- **NextJS** – Framework for React applications
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design
- **TypeScript** – For type safety and maintainability
- **Figma** – For initial UI design and mockups
- **NodeJS** - For implementing the microservices

## 🎨 **Design Process**

- **Figma Designs**: Created initial mockups in Figma to plan the website's layout and design.
- Screenshots and designs are available to showcase the progression from concept to implementation:
- **Order:1. Sitemap Diagram --> 2. Wireframe --> 3. Paper Prototype**
